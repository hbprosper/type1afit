These tutorials show how to use the __[CERN](http://home.cern/)__
minimization package Minuit (developed by __[Dr. Fred James](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fred_James2)__) to fit 
simple cosmological models to the Union 2.1 Type1a
supernova data. Minuit, which is available in the CERN data analysis package __[ROOT](http://root.cern.ch)__, can be used directly or via the probability modeling package 
__[RooFit](https://root.cern.ch/roofit)__. Both ways are illustrated in these tutorials.

## Setup

Install the
__[Jupyter](https://root.cern.ch/root-has-its-jupyter-kernel)__ notebook package for
your operating system.

```
git clone https://github.com/hbprosper/type1afit
cd type1afit
```
Then, run the command
```
jupyter notebook
```
in order to run the notebook in a browser. Navigate to the
desired notebook. (NOTE: your notebook program may be called ipython.)
